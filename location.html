        <h3>Brooklyn</h3>
        <p>Currently, most of my photos are from Brooklyn NY, but I hope to get photos from other places when I have time</p>
        <p>Brooklyn is a pretty good place to take pictures for now since it has a lot of nature but i really want to take some pictures of Manhattan becuase it would be neat to have the contrast between the tall building of the borough and the nature close to it</p>
        
        <h3>Central Park</h3>
        <p>I finally had some time last week to go to Manhattan and got some cool pictures of central park</p>
        <p>It was an especially good opportunity because it was raining</p>

        <h3>More Locations</h3>
        <p>Hopefully coming soon!</p>
